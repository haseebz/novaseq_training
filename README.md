## Library prep

300-500 range is the optimal size

600 cycle sequencing is only available on the MiSeq
On the NovaSeq the maximum can be 500 cycles on the S-prime

Clusters: group of DNA positioned closely together, each cluster represents thousands of copies of the same DNA strand in a 1-2 micron spot. The spot is about a micron. You need to have the dilution of thelibrary such that they can evenly space the single stranded DNA library

MiSeq is 1000 DNA stand cluster
Next seq is a 5000


Patterned Flow cell has a higher cluster density

Shut down the instrument from the software and then shut down the instrument from the switch.

How long do you keep the 1N NaOH before you consider it expired.
Use new bottles/smallest bottle possible.
1N NoOH solutions are not stable enough. Personally not keep it more than 6 months.

Frozen aliquots: Still thorw them out after 6 months.

Paired-end reading
When Illumina started, it could only do 36 bases and that was a knowledge to align them.
But when you have information about the both ends you have a better chance of good alignment.

## Index Reads
Index seq is a separate process
Another limitation of sequencing is longer you sequence, lower the quality of your sequence

Experiment Manager/Local Run Manager/Base Space/

You can use Base Space for run monitoring. Proactive us a component of Basespace.
